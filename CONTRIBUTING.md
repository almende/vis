### Questions

### Bugs, Problems and Feature-Requests

* If you think you found a bug please **provide a simple example** (e.g. on [jsbin](jsbin.com)) that demonstrates the problem.
* If you want to propose a feature-request please **describe what you are looking for in detail**, ideally providing a screenshot, drawing or something similar.

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/vis).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
